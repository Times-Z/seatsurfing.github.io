## Installation

The Microsoft Teams app is available for free in the [Microsoft AppSource marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA200008773).

## Configuration

To enable Seatsurfing accounts in the Microsoft Teams app, administrators must complete the following setup:

- Enable the integration: As organization admin, navigate to “Cloud Features” in the Administration UI to enable the Microsoft Teams integration.
- Create matching user accounts: Ensure each Microsoft Teams user has a corresponding Seatsurfing account where the username matches their Microsoft Teams email address exactly.

If the auth provider option “Allow login of all authenticatable users” is enabled, the users need to use the Seatsurfing login interface once to create their (corresponding) Seatsurfing user accounts.
