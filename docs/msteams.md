## Installation

**The MS Teams app is available for free in the [Microsoft App Store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA200008773).**

## Configuration

To enable Seatsurfing accounts in the MS Teams app, administrators must complete the following setup:

- Enable the integration: As organization admin, navigate to “Cloud Features” in the Administration UI to enable the MS Teams integration.
- Create matching user accounts: Ensure each MS Teams user has a corresponding Seatsurfing account where the username matches their MS Teams email address exactly.

If the auth provider option “Allow login of all authenticatable users” is enabled, the users need to use the Seatsurfing login interface once to create their (corresponding) Seatsurfing user accounts.
