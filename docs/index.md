# Seatsurfing Documentation

Seatsurfing is a cloud native solution for desk sharing, room reservations and co-working in your organisation.

This documentation guides you through creating an account on our servers or installing Seatsurfing on your own servers, placing seats and spaces as an organisation's administrator and using the mobile app on your smartphone.
