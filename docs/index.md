# Getting Started

Seatsurfing is a cloud native solution for desk sharing, room reservations and co-working in your organization.

The easiest way to use Seatsurfing is by creating an account on seatsurfing.io's servers.

We provide a free plan, perfectly suited for testing and small organizations, as well as a paid plan which features unlimited users, exclusive features and premium support.

This documentation guides you through creating an account on our servers or installing Seatsurfing on your own servers, placing seats and spaces as an organization's administrator and using the mobile app on your smartphone.
