        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we’ve released Seatsurfing Backend and App Version 1.7.</p>
<p>With version 1.7, both Seatsurfing’s app and our web booking interface got a brand new design which is much easier to use. Floor plan and search dialog have been integrated, so you can easily change your search criteria and watch the available spaces on the map update instantly. If you already know which spaces you’d like to book, you can switch to the new list mode and pick your favorite desk directly.</p>
<p>While this is the most obvious part of the update, there’s a lot more:</p>
<ul>
<li>New authentication method under the hood which provides more security</li>
<li>New “remember me” functionality</li>
<li>Leave date and time get updated automatically when changing the enter date</li>
<li>Added location time zone support</li>
<li>Added ability to set maximum concurrent location occupancy</li>
<li>Fixed bug which prevented users from booking spaces the same day with active daily basis booking</li>
<li>Fixed bug which caused showing an incorrect booking duration in admin interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Head to <a href="https://seatsurfing.app/">our website</a> for more information on how to get your Seatsurfing installation up and running quickly.</p>

The new version marks a big change in Seatsurfing’s operating model: Seatsurfing’s Backend is now available on Docker Hub and thus allows you to host your Seatsurfing instance on-premises and free of charge. At the same time we’ve removed the Cloud hosting option (for now).

<p>Please also note that Seatsurfing’s App for iPhone and iPad got a new home at the App Store. You should therefore uninstall your existing Seatsurfing App and get the new version from the App Store. The app for Google Android remains at its known place.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we’ve released version 1.2.0 of the Seatsurfing App. This new version includes two new requested features we’re happy to depict here.</p>
<p>The first feature is daily basis booking. We want to make it easier for the employees of some organizations to book their seats. If you want to keep seat booking really easy, you can activate the daily basis booking functionality in the administration interface. When activated, users using the App or the Booking Web Interface just need to pick a desired date and do not need to provide a time range. The selected space is then booked for one or multiple entire days.</p>
<p>The second feature allows for showing the names of the colleagues having booked a space during the selected time range. When activated by the organization’s administrator, users are able to tap or click an occupied seat to show the names and time ranges of this seat. We did not have implemented this feature at first with respect to the users’ privacy. However, we think that you should have the chance to decide for yourself.</p>
