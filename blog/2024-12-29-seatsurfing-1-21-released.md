Time for some release news! Seatsurfing 1.21 has been released today, including several features that you, Seatsurfing's users, asked for. The biggest feature is that you can now specify custom attributes which can be attached to your locations. For example, as an administrator, you can specify whether a location is accessible with wheelchairs or what kind of media system is installed. Your users can view a location's attributes and even filter the list of locations according to their needs.

Enjoy the new features, I wish you a happy new year 2025!
