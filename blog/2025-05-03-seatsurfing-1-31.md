We're happy to announce the availability of Seatsurfing version 1.31. The new version lets users import their bookings into their calendar applications (such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar, Google Mail etc.) using the Booking Web Interface. Additionally, users can opt for receiving booking confirmations via email, and these emails also include an attachment which can be imported to calendars in no time. By the way, we're now sending emails in HTML formatting, providing a greater user experience.
