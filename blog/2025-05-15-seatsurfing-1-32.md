We're happy to announce the availability of Seatsurfing version 1.32. Everything in this new version is about groups: You can now organize your users in groups. These groups can be used as approvers for your spaces, i.e. a space admin in a space's approver group must approve a user's booking request before it becomes definite. Furthermore, you can use groups to restrict users who can book specific spaces, i.e. only users in an allowed group are permitted to place a booking.
